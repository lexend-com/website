I read for a living — it’s basically been exhausting. It’s a relief to be able to read without stress, without my eyes getting tired.

Recently, I started using LEXEND to study my Spanish vocabulary list and raised my Spanish grade from a D to a B in just a few weeks.

With Lexend, my student was reading and _loving_ it. Her participation in the classroom has increased to the point where I have to remind her to “be quiet” in class. Her self-esteem has improved measurably and she is obviously proud of what she is now able to do.

## What makes a good reader?

There is a consensus among researchers and educators that reading fluency is one of the defining characteristics of good readers, and a lack of fluency is a common characteristic of poor readers.

This is important — because it means we’re approaching this problem from an already established perspective, something that educators have been using for decades.

Differences in reading fluency not only distinguish good readers from poor, but a lack of reading fluency is also a reliable predictor of reading comprehension problems.

Once struggling readers learn the relationship between sounds and letters, their lack of fluency emerges as the next hurdle they face on their way to reading proficiency.

This lack of fluent reading is a problem for poor readers because they tend to read in a labored, disconnected fashion — with a focus on decoding at the word level that makes comprehension of the text difficult, if not impossible.

## Fluency is measured in Words Correct Per Minute.

A student reads a story with <TotalNumberOfWords/> words in <TotalAmountOfTime/>. She made <TotalNumberOfErrors/> errors. To determine WCPM (Words Correct Per Minute):

1. Count the total number of words.
   <pre>
     <code>
       <TotalNumberOfWords /> words
     </code>
   </pre>
2. Count the number of mistakes.
   <pre>
     <code>
       <TotalNumberOfErrors /> mistakes
     </code>
   </pre>
3. Take the number of words minus the number of mistakes = number of words read correctly.
   <pre>
     <code>
       <TotalNumberOfWords /> words - <TotalNumberOfErrors /> mistakes ={" "}
       <TotalNumberOfCorrectWords /> correct words
     </code>
   </pre>
4. Convert the time it took to read the passage to seconds.
   <pre>
     <code>
       <TotalAmountOfTime /> to read = <TotalAmountOfTime as="seconds" />s
     </code>
   </pre>
5. Convert the number of seconds to a decimal by dividing the number of seconds by 60. This is the total reading time.
   <pre>
     <code>
       <TotalAmountOfTime as="seconds" />s / 60 ={" "}
       <TotalAmountOfTime as="decimal" /> total reading time
     </code>
   </pre>
6. Divide the number of words read correctly by the total reading time in decimal form.
   <pre>
     <code>
       <TotalNumberOfCorrectWords /> / <TotalAmountOfTime as="decimal" /> ={" "}
       <TotalWordsCorrectPerMinute /> Words Correct per Minute (WCPM)
     </code>
   </pre>

## What if we could turn it around… with typography?

In 1999, as an educational therapist, Bonnie Shaver-Troup, working with clients, began observing that reading issues masked the individual’s true capability and intelligence.

In 2000, Bonnie theorized that reading performance would improve
through use of:

1. A sans-serif font to reduce cognitive noise
2. Expanded scaling to improve potential for character recognition
3. Hyper-expansion of character spacing, which creates a greater lag time and reduces potential crowding and masking effects

These changes led to the development of seven specially-designed fonts, which create an immediate improvement in reading performance.

This is where **Lexend** was formed.

## A variable font empirically shown to significantly improve reading-proficiency.


Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup, utilizing her theory and the LEXEND beta font designs, worked with type designer, Thomas Jockin to formulate an advanced set of typographic variables to coordinate with one simple idea:

A font, much like the prescription in a pair of eyeglasses, should change based on the reader’s unique needs.

Combining some of the newest technology in font software and an educated history in professional type design, Lexend pulls the most important typographic factors in reading-proficiency into a variable font that was designed specifically to fluctuate based on a reader’s Words Correct per Minute score — a typographic system that could be changed to make the words more readable, based on who’s reading them.

## The Demonstration of Effectiveness

20 third graders, eight males and twelve females, read for one minute in five fonts.

All text was set at 16pt and the reading materials were two grade levels above the participants current grade level to ensure the typography was being measured, rather than reading competency.

Each student read out loud a passage set in a control of Times New Roman, then four of the Lexend Series — Deca, Exa, Giga, and Mega.

<LogoList/>

Lexend has been discussed in two Stanford labs, at HP & Microsoft, was listed on Apple K-12 Assistive Technology from 2003-2005, has recently been referenced in research and patents by Adobe, and is available both on Google Fonts & as an open-source download.

## The Valuable Virtues of Variable Font Technology

As the study demonstrates, while the Lexend series were beneficial to a large sample of students, no one setting worked best for all students. Diverse readers call for diverse axis settings just like every individual person requires their own individual eyeglass prescription.

Eyeglass prescriptions are not six strict settings. There are more granular settings possible.

Variable font technology allows for continuous selection of the Lexend Series to find the specific setting for an individual student.

## Team and History

<TeamHeadshots>

<div>

Founded in 2000, LEXEND came about from a desire to make reading easier for everyone. As an Educational Therapist, Bonnie Shaver-Troup, EdD, observed that reading issues masked the individual’s true capability and intelligence. She theorized that these issues were a sensitivity to typographical factors and began manipulating multiple text factors to find a match between text format and an individual’s optimized visual processing capabilities.

After careful research and years of testing a LEXEND beta fonts, Bonnie was able to determine that while traditional approaches to reading issues focused on cognitive-based solutions, perception-based solutions were faster and more efficient in helping improve reading performance and cognition.

In 2017 Bonnie began working with type designer Thomas Jockin to design an online variable-font solution that would ultimately give the reader complete control over their own reading experience and improve retention and comprehension.

What began as a seed in the home office of an educational therapist has become a world-class reading solution available to English-language readers across the world.
