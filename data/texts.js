  My name is Commander Smith and the spaceship that I command has been exploring the planet known as Earth for almost a year. We have discovered that Earth is very different from our planet. Our next job was to explore the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada. These states make up the Southwest region.

  First, we had to backtrack a little and fly east to Texas. This is a huge state—the map showed that it was more than seven hundred miles wide. Later we found out that Texas is the second largest state in size, after Alaska. It is also the second largest state in population, after California. We certainly saw a lot of really big things in Texas—big cities, big oil fields, and big ranches. In fact, we found out that there is a ranch in Texas that is bigger than the whole state of Rhode Island! Texas raises more cattle than any other state. The cowboy, a person who takes care of the cattle, is a symbol of Texas. In the late 1800s, Texas cowboys drove the cattle hundreds of miles to market in the northern states.

  It was hard, dangerous, adventurous work, so many people thought of cowboys as heroes. Over time, the cattle ranches changed so that there was less need for cowboys. Today, there are not as many cowboys in

  Texas. There are, however, many Texans who still dress like cowboys. They wear cowboy boots and a kind of tall cowboy hat they call a ten- gallon-hat because it looks as if it could hold that much water. Another symbol of Texas is the oil well. Texas produces more oil than any other state. Oil was first discovered near the city of Houston in the early 1900s.

  Today, Houston is the largest city in Texas. The American space program has one of its largest workplaces there. One man told us that Houston was the first word spoken on the moon. He explained that when an American became the first human to land on the moon on July 20,1969. The first thing he did was radio back to Houston. The United States was the first manned mission to land on the Moon. There have been six manned U.S. landings and numerous unmanned landings. To date, the United States is the only country to have successfully conducted manned missions to the Moon, with the last one in December 1972.`,

  In our exploration of Texas and the other Southwestern states, we heard many people speaking Spanish, the same language we had heard spoken in parts of Florida. When we studied the history of the Southwest, we learned the reason for this. The Southwest region was not always part of the United States. Instead, it was part of Mexico, the country just to the south of the United States. There, people speak Spanish. In the 1840s, the United States and Mexico went to war over large areas of land in the Southwest. The United States won the war and gained the land that became parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and California.

  Mexican culture still has a strong influence on this region. Many cities here have Spanish names. Today, the region is home to millions of Mexican Americans, many of whom speak both Spanish and English. Spanish is the second most spoken language in the world. Almost 400 million people speak Spanish. English is the third most spoken language in the world, with 335 million people speaking English. Many people in the Southwest enjoy being able to share in the blending of the wonderful food and culture of the region.
  Much of the Southwest is desert-dry, sandy land with few trees. The desert begins in western Texas and covers much of New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada. Very little rain falls in the desert.

  In the summer, it gets hotter than any other part of the United States. Temperatures of 115 or 120 degrees are not unusual. In the summer when the temperature is the hottest most people try to stay inside out of the heat. It gets so hot that people are told not to take their pets outside for walks. This is so pets will not get sick from getting too hot or get burns on their paws. The desert is beautiful, but the climate is not like most of the rest of the country.

  We landed our ship in southern Arizona and went exploring. The desert was very different from most of the other landscapes we had seen. We almost felt as if we were on another planet. Instead of trees, we saw cactus. Some of the cactus were short and round. Others were very tall and had thick "arms" sticking upward from their trunks.`,


  `
  Suddenly we saw something strange-a little bird with long tail feathers and spiky feathers on its head, running quickly across the sand.

  We had never seen a bird run before. Commander Smith explained, "That's a roadrunner. He can fly, but he would rather run." Shewent on to say, "You know, a lot of people think there is no life in the desert, but that is not true. Look- over there is a jackrabbit." Wesawa large brown rabbit hopping out of a bush. Then I said, "Wow! I have found a little lobster." When we looked down, I saw something that did look like a tiny lobster, except it had a long tail that curled back over its body. Commander Smith yelled, "Do not touch that! It is a scorpion. It has a poisonous stinger in its tail, and if it stings you, you will get very sick. "When I heard that it wasnot safe, I jumped back a couple of feet. Fortunately, everyone was okay and so we could continue exploring.

  So, after wehad explored the desert for a little while, I decided that weshould get back inside our ship and fly to northern Arizona. I really wanted to see the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is one of the great natural wonders of the United States.

  It looks like a big hole has been carved out of the Colorado River. It is 277 miles long, over a mile deep, and up to eighteen miles across. Even though it is a canyon it also has many caves which people lived in many years ago.
  If you look out over the edge of the Grand Canyon, you can see the river glistening far, far down at the bottom. Thewalls of the canyon are all different colors - red, brown, white, and yellow. Thecolors come from the layers of different kinds of rock. Like most visitors to the canyon, we just stood there for a long time, looking at it in awe. People on Earth were smart to call this canyon the Grand Canyon because it is very Grand!

  After flying over Nevada, we headed west again, toward the Pacific Ocean. The part of the United States that borders the Pacific is known as the West Coast.`,


  `
  There are three states on the West Coast - CaIifornia, Oregon, and Washington. California is by far the biggest of the three, covering two- thirds of the coast. It also has more people than any other state in the country.

  We decided to begin our exploration of theWest Coast in California. We first visited the city of LosAngeles, the second largest city in the United States. Flying over the city, we were amazed by its size. It spread out as far as the eye couId see in every direction. Welearned that large roads called freeways tie this vast city together. LosAngeles is so spread out that people sometimes spend hours every day in their cars, driving from home to work and then back again to home. Because almost everyone has a car, there are too many cars on the roads, and traffic gets jammed. Americans call the times that they drive to work in the morning and back home at night rush hour.
  The vast city of LosAngeles is home to people of many different backgrounds. As you wander around you hear not only English and Spanish, but also other languages. In fact, there are more than 200 languages spoken in the city of Los Angeles. One of the things I wi11 remember about planet Earth is all the beautiful sounds of all the different languages. Even though languages can sound different, laughter sounds the same everywhere we travel on Earth.

  Los Angeles is famous for its beautifuI sandy beaches. On summer days, the beaches are packed with people who have come there to enjoy themselves. While exploring, we saw some people surfing. The surfers paddled out into the water with their long surf boards. The city of Lo sAngeles is also famous for being the world capital of the movie business. Thousands of movies have been made here.

  Los Angeles is in the southern part of California. Thesouthern part of California, like the Southwest does not receive a large amount of rain. Not getting enough rain can be very serious. People there have developed new technology to solve water shortage problems. No matter where we travel, people on Earth on very smart and find ways to solve their problems.`,


  `
  Flying north to explore the rest of the state, we saw some very different landscapes. To the north, the California coast becomes rocky instead of sandy. Tall cliffs plunge very far down to the ocean, and huge waves explode against the rocks. It is very beautiful.

  Flying inland from the coast, we crossed a range of mountains. Then we came to a long valley that stretches all the way down the center of the state. When we flew low over the valley, we saw that it was covered with farms.

  Later, we learned that this is one of the most important food growing regions of the United States. This region called The Central Valley is 40 to 60 miles wide and stretches 450 miles from north to south. It provides more than half of the fruits, vegetables and nuts grown in the United States.

  Flying farther east, we came to a range of tall mountains. According to the map, the tallest mountain in this range is also the tallest mountain in the United States outside of Alaska. As beautiful as the mountains were, we were eager to see California's other famous city, San Francisco. So, we turned our ship back toward the coast. San Francisco is very different from Los Angeles. San Francisco is full of new skyscrapers as well as old houses. Its parks are lush and green, displaying interesting trees and flowers collected from all over Earth. It is full of all the colors of the rainbow.
  
  The city sits beside a beautiful blue bay. Spanning across this area of water is the famous Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge's two towers are seventy stories tall, and they are connected to the bridge by great swooping cables. Even though the name of the Golden Gate Bridge makes some people think that the bridge might be painted gold, it is not. Just think, that would be a lot of gold paint since the towers are 70 stories tall! Well, even though it has been fun to be in San Francisco and many other places on Earth it is time to go back home. We will always remember traveling to Earth and meeting so many wonderful people and visiting so many beautiful places! Good-bye for now!`
